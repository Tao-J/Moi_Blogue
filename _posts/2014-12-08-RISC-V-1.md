Much of the RISC-V resource was publicized on GitHub. But as [`git-submodule`](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Submodules) is used, it's possible that if a small tool module is updated but a larger project which adopts this module will not update this module until some contributor manually update the `.gitmodules` file. Before that, one has to check if the newer version of the sub-module is compatible with current project. It is at our own risk to update a sub-module without testing out its compatibility.

In an essence of saving time, the following table was intended to figure out the dependencies between this bunch of codes.

The above table tried to explain these bunch of repositories and their functionalities as well as their dependencies.

In consistent with the hierarchy of the above table suggests, three **comprehensive** tutorials are present in [rocket-chip](https://github.com/ucb-bar/rocket-chip),  [riscv-tools](https://github.com/ucb-bar/riscv-tools) and [fpga-zynq](https://github.com/ucb-bar/fpga-zynq) repositories covering about _hardware description, simulation & build toolchain_ and _FPGA verification_ respectively. One who is interested in this topic is recommended to read these documents thoroughly.
