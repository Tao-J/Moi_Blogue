After trying a prebuilt image on Zynq FPGA boards, it's high time to compile the full software stack from scratch so as to gain insights into the RISC-V system.

# Setup code base and environment

First, fetch `rocket-chip`, using following shell commands:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# rocket-chip
git clone https://github.com/ucb-bar/rocket-chip.git
cd rocket-chip
git submodule update --init
cd riscv-tools
git submodule update --init --recursive riscv-tests
# go and have a sweet dream
```

After that, build the tool sets resides in `riscv-tools` folder. Fire up the script below:

```bash
# riscv toolchain
## Dependencies:
## autoconf automake autotools-dev curl
## libmpc-dev libmpfr-dev libgmp-dev gawk
## build-essential bison flex texinfo gperf

## see notes below, don't clone riscv-tools alone
# git clone https://github.com/ucb-bar/riscv-tools.git
# cd riscv-tools
# git submodule update --init --recursive

# add to .bashrc, maybe
export RISCV=~/riscv-toolchain
./build.sh
# go and have a meal
# add to .bashrc, maybe
export PATH=$PATH:$RISCV/bin
```

Run a test to verify if the toolchain is working:

```bash
# test riscv-gcc and spike
vim hello.c
riscv-gcc hello.c -o hello
spike pk hello
##################################
# WARN: as of 2014/12/10
# the latest commit seems to be broken
# when perform
# spike pk hello
# it utters error: Misaligned ....
##################################
```

The commit of `riscv-tools` which `rocket-chip` used, is tested and valid. Newest commit of `riscv-tools` may be broken. So it's recommended that not to clone a `riscv-tools` separately. Please use the repository included in the `rocket-chip` , which points to the right commit.

Update: As ccelio mentioned, this error is fixed by commit [@44b1bee](https://github.com/ucb-bar/riscv-tools/commit/44b1beefa520f796491a3d8f555e662bd79503d1)

## Toolsets included

**emulator**: C simulator
Check if `/bin/sh` links to `/bin/bash`. In Ubuntu, it links to `dash`. The script would fail miserablely.
After `make -j8 run`, one could examine some `*.out` files in the directory named `output`. These files are tests performed on the generated. `$ROCKETCHIP/emulator/generated-src` contains Chisel generated C++ code
**vsim**: Verilog code for simulation on VCS(May be *Synopsys*  is required?).
**fsim**: FPGA-synthesizable Verilog
**vsim**: VLSI-synthesizable Verilog

## Chisel code structure\*

This part is not elaborated in the publicized documents, several questions still persists.
HostIO **More details?**
MemIO **Connected to where? How to connect to on-chip DDR?**
One could _post questions to the [hw-dev](https://lists.riscv.org/lists/subscribe/hw-dev) mailing list._

Also, a dive into `Makefile` may provide much insight into the generation process. _If time permits, this topic will be covered in later posts._

## Parameterized chip configuration\*

It only covered a little on this topic. As the configuration file is written is Scala, which seems an **alien** language to me.

## Compilation and C library concepts\*

**C library** [ref link](#clib_ref)
**The** `SYSROOT` **Concept** [ref link](#sysroot_ref)

We now must instruct the `riscv-linux-gcc` build process to place our system root files in a place we can get to them. We call this directory `SYSROOT`. Let's set our `$SYSROOT` environment variable for easy access throughout the build process. Ensure that this directory is _not_ inside our `$RISCV` variable.

```bash
# define sysroot dir
export RISCVSYSROOT=$RISCV/../riscv-sysroot/

# copy headers
mkdir -p $SYSROOT/usr
cp -r $ROCKETCHIP/riscv-tools/riscv-gcc/linux-headers/* $RISCVSYSROOT/usr
```

In the event that the kernel headers (anything inside `arch/riscv/include/asm/` or in `include/` are changed, you can use the Linux kernel Makefile to generate a new set of Linux headers - see [here](https://github.com/ucb-bar/riscv-tools#linux-headers-install).)

```bash
# cd to riscv-gcc and apply patch
curl -L http://riscv.org/install-guides/sysroot-Makefile.in.patch | patch –p1
./configure
make linux INSTALL_DIR=$RISCV SYSROOT=$SYSROOT
```

## Obtaining and Patching the Kernel Sources

Obtaining kernel patch.

```bash
cd ~
git clone git@github.com:ucb-bar/riscv-linux.git linux-3.14.17
# git checkout 84ee1c6
# see below
```

Download the current minor revision of the 3.14 Linux kernel from [The Linux Kernel Archives](http://www.kernel.org/). The `-k` switch ensures that`.gitignore` and `README` files don't get clobbered.

```bash
curl -L ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v3.x/linux-3.14.17.tar.xz | tar -xJk
make ARCH=riscv defconfig
make ARCH=riscv menuconfig
make -j8 ARCH=riscv
```

## Build BusyBox

```bash
curl -L http://busybox.net/downloads/busybox-1.21.1.tar.bz2 | tar –xj
cd busybox-1.21.1
make allnoconfig
```

`CONFIG_CROSS_COMPILER_PREFIX=riscv-linux-`, listed as "Cross Compiler prefix" in BusyBox Settings → Build Options

## Pack a rootfs

`cd` into kernel source directory and create a root image

```bash
# produce a file with 64MiB zero
dd if=/dev/zero of=root.bin bs=1M count=64
# make it a ext2 filesystem
mkfs.ext2 -F root.bin

# mount the disk image to modify it
mkdir mnt
```

Following commands requires **superuser** permission, please understands what they mean, and execute them **carefullly**.

```bash
mount -o loop root.bin mnt # modern kernels usually supports /dev/loop devices

# make sys dirs
cd mnt && mkdir -p bin etc dev lib proc sbin tmp usr usr/bin usr/lib usr/sbin

# copy BusyBox into the mounted fs
sudo cp ../../busybox-1.21.1/busybox bin
```

Create initialization table `/etc/inittab`

```conf
::sysinit:/bin/busybox mount -t proc proc /proc
::sysinit:/bin/busybox mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /tmp
::sysinit:/bin/busybox mount -o remount,rw /dev/htifbd0 /
::sysinit:/bin/busybox --install -s
/dev/console::sysinit:-/bin/ash
```

**Explanation** [ref link](#inittab_ref)
**Warn:** comment out line 4 after first boot, symlinks created at the first boot are persist in the filesystem. Or some harmless warning would pop out during the boot procedure.

```bash
# NOTE: this symlink refers to relative path, 山口山
ln -s ../bin/busybox sbin/init

# finishing up
cd ..
umount mnt
```

**Return to user permission shell**
run `spike +disk=root.bin vmlinux`

### Appendix

**C library** [back](#clib_back)
Newlib is a "C library intended for use on embedded systems." It has the advantage of not having so much cruft as Glibc at the obvious cost of incomplete support (and idiosyncratic behavior) in the fringes. The porting process is much less complex than that of Glibc because you only have to fill in a few stubs of glue code.

These stubs of code include the system calls that are supposed to call into the operating system you're running on. Because there's no operating system proper, the simulator runs, on top of it, a proxy kernel (riscv-pk) to handle many system calls, like open, close, and printf.

**The** `SYSROOT` **Concept\*** [back](#sysroot_back)

When installing these toolchains, the `make` system often generates a wide variety of libraries and other files. In particular, building Glibc involves building the run-time dynamic linker and the C standard library (`ld.so.1` and `libc.so.6`, in this case). These, together with header files like `stdio.h`, comprise the _system root_, an often-necessary set of files for a fully operational system.

When we built `riscv-tools`, there was no need for specifying where to install these files, because we assumed we would always be running on the host machine through a simulator; all of the libraries are on the _host_ system. Now that we're running our binaries from within an operating system, we will have to provide these libraries and headers if we want to run dynamically-linked binaries and compile programs natively.

**The inittab file** [back](#inittab_back)

This script first mounts `procfs` `tmpfs` filesystem onto `/proc` and `/tmp`. HTIF-virtualized block device (`htifbd`) is mounted onto root.
Then, BusyBox applet symbolic links was installed.
Finally, an `ash` shell on the HTIF-virtualized TTY (`console`, mapped to `ttyHTIF`) is opened.
_(What’s this?)_ If `getty` is desired change the 5th line to `::respawn:/bin/busybox getty 38400 ttyHTIF0`.
